## Codebase Patterns
- Shiny app source files are in `peskas.timor.portal/R/`
- Color palettes defined in `app_server.R` (habitatPalette, tabPalette, donutBlue, spiderColors)
- App uses ApexCharts for charts, DeckGL for hexagon map, Leaflet for 2D maps
- Data files stored in `public/data/*.json` (converted from R RDA files)
- All text uses i18n from `pars.json` with keys like `pars.header.nav.home.text`
- Map center coordinates: lat `-8.75`, lng `125.7`, zoom `8`

- Verified shiny-analysis.md already exists with comprehensive documentation
- Confirmed all acceptance criteria met:
  - Complete list of all Shiny tabs and modules (7 tabs)
  - Chart types documented (ApexCharts, DeckGL, Leaflet)
  - Color palettes extracted (6 palettes with hex values)
  - Mapping document created at scripts/ralph/shiny-analysis.md
- No files changed (document already existed from previous iteration)
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Always check if work was already completed before starting
  - The shiny-analysis.md is the central reference for Shiny→React mapping
  - React component structure proposal is in shiny-analysis.md

# Peskas Timor Portal

This project is a React + TypeScript dashboard built with [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/).

## Development

- `npm run dev` – start the development server with hot module reloading.
- `npm run build` – type‑check and create a production build in the `dist/` folder.
- `npm run lint` – run ESLint against the source files.
- `npm run fetch-data` – export MongoDB collections to `public/data`.

The data fetching script relies on the following environment variables:

- `MONGODB_URI` – MongoDB connection string.
- `MONGODB_DB` – name of the database.
- `MONGODB_COLLECTIONS` – comma separated list of collections to export.

## Deployment on Vercel

The included `vercel.json` configures Vercel to build the app and serve the static files generated by Vite.

- **Build command:** `npm run build`
- **Output directory:** `dist`
- **Client-side routing:** all requests are rewritten to `index.html` so React Router can handle routing.

To deploy:

1. Create a project on [Vercel](https://vercel.com) and link this repository.
2. Define any required environment variables if you plan to run `npm run fetch-data` during the build.
3. Push to the main branch or use the Vercel CLI to trigger a deployment.

The site will be served as a static application from the generated `dist/` directory.
